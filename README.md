# File-Type-Script
This is a Script I wrote in Python while interning at Forest Lawn Memorial Parks and Mortuaries.
My task was to create a python script that would scan a certain directory, extract all of the PDFs from that directory (including subdirectories) and display them in a list format.
To launch this file, simplly open the file and run the script (after changing the `dir_mid` and `dir_name` to your choosing of course!)
